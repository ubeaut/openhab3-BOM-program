# openhab3-BOM-program
OpenHab3 BOM weather forecasts that uses NO thing and only ONE item.
There is already a BOM add-on for openhab and I have used it and it is good but I didn't want to have
another 90 plus items created just to use it.
What I have attempted to do is use one item and put all the weather forecast for your location into that 
as json format and then just pull out the data we want to use.

What this doesn't do is have the latest temperature etc.
It will just display the forecast for the next 7 days.
Nothing flash....if you want all the other bells and whistles then go and grab the other BOM add-on.
